# Contributing to Healthcare Reform Ideas

Thank you for your interest in improving healthcare! This document outlines how to contribute.

## ⚠️ Critical Rule: Every Idea Must Have a Source WITH LINKS

**This repository does not accept unsourced ideas.** Every reform proposal must be attributed to:
- A specific person (e.g., "Mark Cuban", "Dr. Atul Gawande")
- An organization (e.g., "Kaiser Family Foundation")
- A published study or paper
- An official policy proposal
- Your own original idea (mark clearly as "Original proposal by [your name]")

**🔗 LINKS ARE REQUIRED** — Every source must include a URL so readers can verify the information.

**Why this matters:** Healthcare policy affects lives. Ideas need accountability, credibility, and verifiability.

### Source Quality Standards

| ✅ Credible Sources | ❌ Avoid |
|---------------------|----------|
| Peer-reviewed journals (JAMA, NEJM, Health Affairs) | Random blogs or Medium posts |
| Government reports (HHS, CBO, FTC) | Unverified social media claims |
| Reputable news (Reuters, AP, WSJ, NYT, WaPo) | Partisan outlets without evidence |
| Expert testimony (Congressional hearings) | Anonymous or pseudonymous claims |
| Official policy documents | Conspiracy theories |
| Established think tanks (Brookings, AEI, Urban Institute) | Outlets with known misinformation |

### Writing Principles

- **Be specific** — Include numbers, dates, and concrete mechanisms
- **Cite everything with links** — Every statistic, quote, and claim needs a verifiable source URL
- **Consider trade-offs** — No solution is perfect; acknowledge downsides
- **Stay constructive** — Focus on solutions, not just complaints
- **Bipartisan tone** — Frame ideas to appeal across political spectrum
- **International examples welcome** — Other countries' systems are valid evidence
