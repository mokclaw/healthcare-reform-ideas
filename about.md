## What is This?

A community-driven library of healthcare reform ideas focused on:
- Lowering out-of-pocket costs for patients
- Reducing health insurance premiums
- Increasing transparency in pricing
- Eliminating unnecessary middlemen
- Improving overall health outcomes

## Why This Matters

The US healthcare system is notoriously expensive and opaque. Americans spend more on healthcare than any other developed nation, yet often receive worse outcomes.

As Mark Cuban has demonstrated with [Cost Plus Drugs](https://costplusdrugs.com), transparency and cutting out middlemen can reduce drug prices by 90% or more. There are solutions — they just need to be collected, researched, and advocated for.

## How It Works

1. **Collect Ideas** — We gather reform proposals from credible sources
2. **Document Evidence** — Every idea must have supporting data
3. **Attribute Sources** — Transparency about where ideas come from
4. **Build Consensus** — Focus on bipartisan, practical solutions

## Who Can Contribute?

Anyone with a credible, sourced healthcare reform idea:
- Policy researchers
- Healthcare professionals
- Patients with lived experience
- Journalists and investigators
- Concerned citizens
