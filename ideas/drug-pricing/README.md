# Drug Pricing Reform Ideas

## 1. Cost-Plus Drug Pricing Model

**Proposed by:** Mark Cuban (Cost Plus Drugs)

**The Idea:**
Sell medications at transparent cost-plus pricing:
- Actual manufacturing cost
- + 15% markup (profit margin)
- + $3 pharmacy handling fee
- + $5 shipping fee

**Real-World Impact:**
- Droxidopa: $20/month vs $3,000+/month uninsured
- Chemotherapy drug: $30 vs $2,000 at traditional pharmacies
- Studies show Medicare could save billions buying just 9 specific drugs this way

**Why It Works:**
- Eliminates Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) who mark up prices
- Transparent pricing allows market competition
- Patients know exactly what they're paying for

**Implementation Path:**
- [ ] Legislation requiring price transparency for all drug sales
- [ ] Medicare/Medicaid pilot programs
- [ ] Employer health plan adoption
- [ ] Consumer education campaigns

## 2. PBM Reform: Eliminate Spread Pricing

**The Problem:**
PBMs (CVS Caremark, Express Scripts, OptumRx) control 90% of prescriptions and:
- Hide actual drug costs from patients and employers
- Keep rebates instead of passing them to patients
- Steer patients to their own pharmacies

**The Solution:**
Mandate pass-through PBMs that:
- Show all claims data transparently
- Pass 100% of rebates to patients/employers
- Charge flat administrative fees instead of percentage markups

**Evidence:**
- FTC interim report confirms big PBMs overcharge for cancer drugs
- Pass-through PBMs already exist and operate at fraction of the cost
- Cost Plus Drugs works with 4+ pass-through PBMs successfully

## 3. Publish All Drug Pricing Contracts

**Proposed by:** Mark Cuban / Cost Plus Drugs

**The Idea:**
Make all pharmaceutical pricing contracts public:
- Hospital system agreements
- PBM contracts
- Manufacturer deals

**Why It Matters:**
- Currently, pricing is opaque and varies wildly
- No consumer can comparison shop
- Employers can't negotiate effectively without data

**Status:**
Cost Plus Drugs is pioneering this by publishing all their customer contracts online.

## 4. Importation of Lower-Cost Drugs

**The Idea:**
Allow safe importation of FDA-approved drugs from countries with lower prices (Canada, EU, etc.)

**Current Status:**
- FDA has approved some importation programs
- Cost Plus Drugs received FDA approval to import syphilis drug in shortage
- Politically popular but faces pharmaceutical industry opposition

**Challenges:**
- Safety verification
- Supply chain integrity
- International trade agreements

## 5. Generic Drug Manufacturing Incentives

**The Idea:**
Increase domestic generic drug manufacturing to:
- Reduce shortages
- Lower prices through competition
- Decrease reliance on foreign supply chains

**Real-World Example:**
Cost Plus Drugs now manufactures their own generics in a Dallas facility, starting with critical ICU drugs like epinephrine and norepinephrine.

**Policy Levers:**
- Tax incentives for domestic manufacturing
- FDA fast-track approval for critical generics
- Government contracts guaranteeing purchase volumes
