# Drug Pricing Reform Ideas

## 1. Cost-Plus Drug Pricing Model

**Proposed by:** [Mark Cuban](https://www.markcuban.com/) (via [Cost Plus Drugs Company](https://costplusdrugs.com/))

**Source:** 
- [Interview with Jon Stewart on The Daily Show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_I3rK1--9sk), February 2024
- [WIRED: The Big Interview with Mark Cuban](https://www.wired.com/story/big-interview-mark-cuban-2024/), December 2024

**The Idea:**
Sell medications at transparent cost-plus pricing:
- Actual manufacturing cost
- + 15% markup (profit margin)
- + $3 pharmacy handling fee
- + $5 shipping fee

**Real-World Impact:**
- Droxidopa: $20/month vs $3,000+/month uninsured ([Source: Cuban, WIRED interview](https://www.wired.com/story/big-interview-mark-cuban-2024/))
- Chemotherapy drug: $30 vs $2,000 at traditional pharmacies ([Source: Fierce Healthcare](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/health-tech/mark-cuban-wants-keep-shaking-healthcare-heres-cost-plus-drugs-next-move), August 2024)
- Studies show Medicare could save billions buying just 9 specific drugs this way ([Source: Cuban citing independent studies, 2024](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/health-tech/mark-cuban-wants-keep-shaking-healthcare-heres-cost-plus-drugs-next-move))

**Why It Works:**
- Eliminates Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) who mark up prices
- Transparent pricing allows market competition
- Patients know exactly what they're paying for

**Implementation Path:**
- [ ] Legislation requiring price transparency for all drug sales
- [ ] Medicare/Medicaid pilot programs
- [ ] Employer health plan adoption
- [ ] Consumer education campaigns

## 2. PBM Reform: Eliminate Spread Pricing

**Proposed by:** [Federal Trade Commission (FTC)](https://www.ftc.gov/), Mark Cuban, various health economists

**Sources:** 
- [FTC Interim Staff Report on Pharmacy Benefit Managers](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/07/ftc-staff-report-finds-pharmacy-benefit-managers-exert-outsize-influence-drug-prices-availability), July 2024
- [Mark Cuban interviews on PBM practices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_I3rK1--9sk), 2023-2024

**The Problem:**
PBMs (CVS Caremark, Express Scripts, OptumRx) control 90% of prescriptions and:
- Hide actual drug costs from patients and employers
- Keep rebates instead of passing them to patients
- Steer patients to their own pharmacies

**The Solution:**
Mandate pass-through PBMs that:
- Show all claims data transparently
- Pass 100% of rebates to patients/employers
- Charge flat administrative fees instead of percentage markups

**Evidence:**
- [FTC interim report confirms big PBMs overcharge for cancer drugs](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/07/ftc-staff-report-finds-pharmacy-benefit-managers-exert-outsize-influence-drug-prices-availability) (FTC, 2024)
- Pass-through PBMs already exist and operate at fraction of the cost
- Cost Plus Drugs works with 4+ pass-through PBMs successfully (Rightway, EmsanaRx, RxPreferred Benefits, PCA Rx)

## 3. Publish All Drug Pricing Contracts

**Proposed by:** [Mark Cuban](https://www.markcuban.com/) / [Cost Plus Drugs Company](https://costplusdrugs.com/)

**Source:** [Announcement on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_I3rK1--9sk), February 2024

**The Idea:**
Make all pharmaceutical pricing contracts public:
- Hospital system agreements
- PBM contracts
- Manufacturer deals

**Why It Matters:**
- Currently, pricing is opaque and varies wildly
- No consumer can comparison shop
- Employers can't negotiate effectively without data

**Status:**
[Cost Plus Drugs is pioneering this](https://costplusdrugs.com/) by publishing all their customer contracts online — a first in the industry.

## 4. Safe Importation of Lower-Cost Drugs

**Proposed by:** Various policymakers; [FDA](https://www.fda.gov/) under both Trump and Biden administrations

**Sources:**
- [FDA Drug Importation Programs](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-supply-chain-integrity/drug-importation-action-plan), established under Section 804 of the FD&C Act
- [Cost Plus Drugs FDA approval for syphilis drug importation](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/health-tech/mark-cuban-wants-keep-shaking-healthcare-heres-cost-plus-drugs-next-move), July 2024

**The Idea:**
Allow safe importation of FDA-approved drugs from countries with lower prices (Canada, EU, etc.)

**Current Status:**
- FDA has approved some state importation programs (Florida, etc.)
- Cost Plus Drugs received FDA approval to import syphilis drug in shortage (July 2024)
- Politically popular but faces pharmaceutical industry opposition

**Challenges:**
- Safety verification
- Supply chain integrity
- International trade agreements

## 5. Generic Drug Manufacturing Incentives

**Proposed by:** [Mark Cuban](https://www.markcuban.com/) / [Cost Plus Drugs](https://costplusdrugs.com/); various health policy experts

**Source:** [Fierce Healthcare interview with Alex Oshmyansky, M.D., Ph.D., CEO of Cost Plus Drugs](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/health-tech/mark-cuban-wants-keep-shaking-healthcare-heres-cost-plus-drugs-next-move), 2023-2024

**The Idea:**
Increase domestic generic drug manufacturing to:
- Reduce shortages
- Lower prices through competition
- Decrease reliance on foreign supply chains (particularly India/China)

**Real-World Example:**
Cost Plus Drugs now manufactures their own generics in a [22,000 sq ft Dallas facility](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/health-tech/mark-cuban-wants-keep-shaking-healthcare-heres-cost-plus-drugs-next-move), starting with critical ICU drugs like epinephrine and norepinephrine.

**Policy Levers:**
- Tax incentives for domestic manufacturing
- FDA fast-track approval for critical generics
- Government contracts guaranteeing purchase volumes
