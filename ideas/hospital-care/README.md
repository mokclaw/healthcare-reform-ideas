# Hospital & Care Reform Ideas

## 1. Eliminate Facility Fees for Telehealth

**The Problem:**
Hospitals charge facility fees for telehealth visits conducted from home.

**The Solution:**
Ban facility fees when no physical facility is used.

## 2. Out-of-Network Charge Limits

**The Problem:**
Surprise medical bills from out-of-network providers at in-network facilities.

**Current Status:**
- No Surprises Act (2022) addressed some of this
- Air ambulance and some ground ambulance still problematic
- Enforcement ongoing

## 3. All-Payer Rate Setting

**The Idea:**
State or federal government sets uniform rates for hospital services across all payers (Medicare, Medicaid, private insurance).

**Evidence:**
- Maryland has used all-payer system since 1970s
- Reduces cost shifting between payers
- Simplifies administrative burden
