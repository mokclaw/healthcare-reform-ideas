# Insurance Reform Ideas

## 1. Transparent Premium Pricing

**The Problem:**
Health insurance premiums are opaque and rising faster than inflation.

**The Solution:**
Require insurers to disclose:
- Administrative cost ratio (currently 15-20%)
- Executive compensation
- Actual medical loss ratios by plan
- Network adequacy metrics

## 2. Direct Primary Care Integration

**The Idea:**
Allow Direct Primary Care (DPC) memberships to be:
- HSA-eligible expenses
- Count toward deductible calculations
- Integrated with high-deductible plans

**Benefits:**
- Reduces emergency room visits
- Improves preventive care
- Lowers overall system costs

## 3. Price Transparency Mandate

**The Idea:**
Require all healthcare providers to publish cash prices for common procedures.

**Current Status:**
- Hospital price transparency rule exists but enforcement is weak
- Many hospitals still non-compliant
- No standardized format for comparison

**Improvements Needed:**
- Standardized pricing formats
- Real penalties for non-compliance
- Consumer-friendly comparison tools
