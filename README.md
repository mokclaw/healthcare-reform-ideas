# Healthcare Reform Ideas

A community-driven library of healthcare reform ideas focused on lowering patient costs, reducing insurance premiums, and improving the US healthcare system.

## Mission

To collect, organize, and promote practical healthcare reform ideas that can:
- Lower out-of-pocket costs for patients
- Reduce health insurance premiums
- Increase transparency in pricing
- Eliminate unnecessary middlemen
- Improve overall health outcomes

## Why This Matters

The US healthcare system is notoriously expensive and opaque. As Mark Cuban has demonstrated with Cost Plus Drugs, transparency and cutting out middlemen can reduce drug prices by 90%+.

> *"I don't want to be 95 and look and say 'I was president,' but I didn't get to know my kids at all. I'd rather say, 'I f---ed up healthcare and everybody's healthier and got a better world to live in."* — Mark Cuban
