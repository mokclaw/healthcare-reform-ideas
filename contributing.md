# Contributing to Healthcare Reform Ideas

Thank you for your interest in improving healthcare!

## ⚠️ Critical Rule: Every Idea Must Have a Source

**This repository does not accept unsourced ideas.** Every reform proposal must be attributed to:
- A specific person (e.g., "Mark Cuban", "Dr. Atul Gawande")
- An organization (e.g., "Kaiser Family Foundation")
- A published study or paper
- An official policy proposal
- Your own original idea (mark clearly as "Original proposal by [your name]")

## How to Contribute

### Submit an Issue (Easiest)

Use our templates on GitHub:
- **[Submit New Idea](https://github.com/mokclaw/healthcare-reform-ideas/issues/new?template=new_reform_idea.md)**
- **[Update Existing Idea](https://github.com/mokclaw/healthcare-reform-ideas/issues/new?template=update_idea.md)**

### Source Quality Standards

| ✅ Credible Sources | ❌ Avoid |
|---------------------|----------|
| Peer-reviewed journals | Random blogs |
| Government reports | Unverified social media |
| Reputable news | Partisan outlets without evidence |
| Expert testimony | Anonymous claims |

## Code of Conduct

- Be respectful and constructive
- No personal attacks
- Focus on policy, not politics
- Welcome diverse perspectives
